"""
game.py
Defines the Game class, responsible for managing the main gameplay loop, player turns,
and game-over detection for both human and AI opponents.

Separation of concerns:
- Game orchestrates player turns, win/draw logic, and interacts with Board and Player subclasses.
- No direct I/O except for board/game messagesâ€”adapting for GUI or network play is straightforward.
- Easily extensible (custom AI/Player strategies, custom end conditions, etc).
