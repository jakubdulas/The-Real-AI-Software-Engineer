The game should:\n- Allow two human players to take turns OR one player to play against a simple AI,\n- Display the board after each move using ASCII,\n- Validate player input (e.g., disallow overwriting occupied cells),\n- Detect wins and draws and end the game accordingly,\n- Use modular code: ideally include classes or functions for Player, Board, Game Logic, and AI (even in a single file).\n\nInclude comments and structure the code to be easy to extend."}
