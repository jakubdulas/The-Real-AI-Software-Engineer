Sure! Here's the **English translation** of the proposed 6 projects for your multi-agent coding system:

---

## 🧮 **Simple Console Applications**

### ✅ **Project 1 (Single-file): Temperature Converter**

- **Description:** A simple converter between °C, °F, and K.
- **Input:** User provides value and units.
- **Output:** Converted value.
- **Features:**

  - CLI interface.
  - Error handling (e.g., invalid input like `abc`).
  - Everything in a single file, e.g., `converter.py`.

#### 🎯 Requirements:

- Correct conversion between all 3 units.
- Simple command-line interaction.
- Testable code (e.g., function `convert(value, from_unit, to_unit)`).

---

### ✅ **Project 2 (Multi-file): CLI Note Manager**

- **Description:** Allows creating, deleting, and viewing notes via terminal.
- **Features:**

  - Save notes to a file (e.g., JSON/CSV).
  - Each note has a title, content, timestamp.
  - User menu with options.
  - Requires multiple files:

    - `main.py` – user interface.
    - `note.py` – `Note` class.
    - `storage.py` – file read/write operations.
    - `utils.py` – helper functions.

#### 🎯 Requirements:

- Modular structure.
- Separated logic and I/O for easier testing.
- Well-documented functions.

---

## 🎮 **Games**

### ✅ **Project 3: Tic Tac Toe**

- **Description:** Classic 3x3 game in the terminal for 2 players or player vs AI.
- **Features:**

  - ASCII board rendering.
  - Simple AI (e.g., picks random empty cell).
  - Win/draw detection.

#### 🎯 Requirements:

- Modular code (e.g., `Board`, `Player`, `AI` as classes or functions).
- Logic test coverage.

---

### ✅ **Project 4: Snake Game with GUI**

- **Description:** Classic Snake game with a GUI, e.g., using Pygame.
- **Features:**

  - Keyboard controls.
  - Snake grows after eating.
  - Collision detection (walls or itself).

#### 🎯 Requirements:

- Use of Pygame.
- Modular structure.
- FPS control.
- Visual board and score display.

---

## 🌐 **Web Applications**

### ✅ **Project 5: TODO List (Backend + simple frontend)**

- **Description:** Web app for task management.
- **Features:**

  - REST API (`GET`, `POST`, `DELETE`, `PATCH`).
  - Tasks have title, status, and optional due date.
  - Simple frontend (HTML+JS) that consumes the API.

#### 🎯 Requirements:

- Backend using Flask, Django, or FastAPI.
- Frontend separated.
- API test coverage.

---

### ✅ **Project 6: Weather App (frontend querying external API)**

- **Description:** Web app that displays weather data for a selected city.
- **Features:**

  - Fetches weather data from a public API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap).
  - Displays temperature, humidity, conditions, etc.

#### 🎯 Requirements:

- Basic HTML + JS frontend using fetch.
- Dynamic data rendering.
- Modular JavaScript (e.g., `weather.js`, `ui.js`).

---

## 🧠 **Additionally, you can measure:**

- **Time taken** by the agent to generate the code.
- **Token usage**, using tools like `tiktoken` (for OpenAI) or equivalents.
- **Code complexity**, e.g., with cyclomatic complexity metrics (`radon`).
- **Distance to ideal solution** – via **Levenshtein distance**.
- **Testability and maintainability index**.

---

Let me know if you’d like me to create a **functional specification** or **unit test template** for any of these projects.
