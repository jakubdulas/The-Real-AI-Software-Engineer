# graph.py

This module implements a Chain of Thought (CoT) mechanism for coding tasks, allowing for incremental reasoning and decision-making based on user specifications. It constructs a reasoning graph that can facilitate the identification of next steps in problem-solving.

## Classes

### Configuration
A typed dictionary that defines configuration parameters for the reasoning process, including:
- `max_depth` (int): Maximum number of reasoning steps to be taken.
- `max_candidates` (int): Maximum number of candidate paths to consider.

### CoTState
A subclass of `MessagesState` that maintains the state of the CoT mechanism, composed of:
- `intermediate_steps` (Annotated[list[str], add]): A list of reasoning steps that the agent has taken.
- `last_step` (bool): Flag indicating if the last step of the reasoning process has been reached.

### ThoughtSchema
A Pydantic model representing the outcome of a reasoning step, including:
- `thought` (str): The next step to follow in the reasoning process.
- `finish` (bool): Indicates whether this thought concludes the task.

## Functions

### _ensure_configurable(config: RunnableConfig) -> Configuration
- **Description**: Retrieves or sets default values for the configuration parameters needed for reasoning.

### reasoning_node(state: CoTState, config: Configuration) -> CoTState
- **Description**: Generates the next reasoning step by interacting with an LLM (language model), formatting the prompt based on previous steps and current requirements.

### should_continue(state: CoTState, config: RunnableConfig) -> Literal["reasoning_node", "__end__"]
- **Description**: Determines if the reasoning process should continue or terminate based on the completion status or maximum depth.

## Graph Building
Constructs a state graph that enables the flow of reasoning through defined nodes and edges, allowing for iterative thought processing until the task is either completed or the maximum depth is reached.

## Main Execution Block
When executed directly, this module initiates the reasoning graph for a user's query and prints the resulting intermediate steps in the thought process.
