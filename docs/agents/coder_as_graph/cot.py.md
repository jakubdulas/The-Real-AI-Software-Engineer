# cot.py

This module implements a chain of thought (CoT) reasoning process for generating step-by-step solutions for programming tasks, utilizing a state graph structure.

## Classes

### `Configuration`

A `TypedDict` used for dynamically defining configuration options for the reasoning process, including:
- `max_depth` (int): The maximum depth for reasoning steps.
- `max_candidates` (int): The maximum number of candidates for each step.

### `CoTState`

An extension of `MessagesState` that includes:
- `intermediate_steps` (Annotated[list[str], add]): A list of intermediate reasoning steps.
- `last_step` (bool): Indicates whether the last step of reasoning has been reached.

### `ThoughtSchema`

Represents a single thought process with the following attributes:
- `thought` (str): The reasoning step to solve a given task.
- `finish` (bool): A flag indicating if this thought is the last required step.

## Variables

### `thinker_template`

A string template that guides the LLM in thinking through the next steps to solve a programming problem, taking into account previously executed steps.

### `thinker_prompt`

A `PromptTemplate` object created using `thinker_template`, defining input variables as `system_prompt` and `intermediate_steps`.

## Functions

### `reasoning_node(state: CoTState, config: Configuration) -> CoTState`

Processes the reasoning node utilizing the LLM to determine the next step in solving a programming task.

#### Parameters:
- `state` (CoTState): The current state of intermediate steps and messages.
- `config` (Configuration): Configuration options for the reasoning process.

#### Returns:
- `CoTState`: The updated state containing a new intermediate step and a flag for the last step.

### `should_continue(state: CoTState, config: RunnableConfig) -> Literal["reasoning_node", "__end__"]`

Checks whether to proceed with additional reasoning nodes or terminate the process based on depth or completion status.

#### Parameters:
- `state` (CoTState): The current state of reasoning.
- `config` (RunnableConfig): Configuration settings guiding the decision process.

#### Returns:
- `Literal`: Either "reasoning_node" to continue or "__end__" to terminate the reasoning process.

## Graph Builder

`graph_builder` constructs the logic flow of the CoT state, including nodes and conditional edges to manage reasoning steps.
