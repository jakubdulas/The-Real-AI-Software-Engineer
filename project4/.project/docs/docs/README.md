# Snake Game

A modular Snake game built using Pygame.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository** (if downloaded as source):
   ```sh
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_folder>
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   The game requires Python 3 and the Pygame library. Install all required dependencies using pip:

   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   
   This will automatically install `pygame` and any other requirements specified.

## Running the Game

Run the main game script (replace `snake_game.py` with the name of the main file, if different):

```sh
python snake_game.py
```

A new window will open, displaying the game grid and the snake.

## Game Controls

- **Arrow Keys ← ↑ → ↓**: Control the direction of the snake’s movement.
- **ESC or Closing the Window**: Quits the game.

## Goal

Eat the red apple to grow the snake and increase your score. Avoid colliding with the walls or the snake’s own body; the game ends upon collision.

Enjoy playing!
