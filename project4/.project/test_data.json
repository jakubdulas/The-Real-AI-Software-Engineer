The game should:\n- Render a visual grid with a snake that moves based on arrow key input,\n- Include an apple that randomly spawns on the grid; the snake grows after eating it,\n- Detect collisions with walls or itself and end the game accordingly,\n- Display the player's score,\n- Organize the code into logical components: game loop, rendering, input handling, and collision logic.\n\nMake the code modular and readable. Include a `requirements.txt` file if external libraries are needed."}
