## Features
- **Search for any city:** Enter a city name and retrieve current weather conditions.

## Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites
- A web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, etc)
- An OpenWeatherMap API key (sign up at https://openweathermap.org/api for free)

### 2. Project Structure
```
index.html
style.css
app.js
js/
  api.js
  ui.js
```

### 3. Setting Up the API Key
1. Open `js/api.js` in a text/code editor.
2. Replace `'YOUR_API_KEY'` with your own OpenWeatherMap API key:
   ```js
   const OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY = 'your_real_api_key_here';
   ```
3. Save the file.

### 4. Running the App
Just open `index.html` **directly in your browser**. No build steps or server are needed!

## File Documentation
- `js/api.js`: Handles all API requests to OpenWeatherMap. Throws clear errors on failure.
- `js/ui.js`: Updates the web page with weather data or friendly errors.
- `app.js`: Orchestrates user interaction, coordinates API/UI updates.

Refer to each file's `.md` documentation for in-depth details!

## Troubleshooting
- **Nothing happens / no data:** Make sure you set a valid API key in `js/api.js`.
- **CORS error:** OpenWeatherMap supports browser requests, but check your network if issues persist.
- **City not found:** Check spelling; some cities may have multiple matches â€” try adding country (e.g., `Paris, FR`).
